# Must print a string with a space-separated list of versions. Example output would be the following:
#
# 1.0.1 1.0.2 1.3.0 1.4
#
# Note that the newest version should be listed last so it appears closer to the user's prompt.
# This is helpful since the list-all command prints each version on it's own line.
# If there are many versions it's possible the early versions will be off screen.
#
# If versions are being pulled from releases page on a website it's recommended to not
# sort the versions if at all possible. Often the versions are already in the correct order or,
# in reverse order, in which case something like tac should suffice. If you must sort versions manually
# you cannot rely on sort -V since it is not supported on OSX. An alternate sort function like this is a better choice.
